***A friendly recipes website for all family...***
Social Recipes was the third project on Campus Code bootcamp aiming to put on test our skills to develop software by ourselves and to face the challenges provided by that.   
This project was developed during one week of remote work, and every student developed their own version, implementing mandatory features and also some extra ones as they see fit.   
In my version I used bootstrap to make it responsive, added a carousel on the homepage with the most favorited recipes, allowed authentication, so users have a profile page, post their recipes and favorite other user's recipes. Recipes are categorized by cuisine, preference or type of meal.   
This project is always active. As I learn new things, I implement them.

## Features
* **Visitor can view individual recipes or an index with several of them.**
* **Authenticated users can post and edit their recipes.**
* **Only admins can create or edit courses of meal, preferences and cuisines.**
* **Users can favorite recipes**
* **Users can visit other user's profiles**
* **Bootstrap added for responsiveness**

## Future developments
* **Users will be able to follow other users.**
* **Users will be able to interact with this other user by sending messages, suggesting recipes, etc. **
* **Users will be able to send recipes through email.**
* **Users will be able to search for recipes by typing.**
